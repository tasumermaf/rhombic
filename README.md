# rhombic

> *The bottleneck is not the processor. It is the shape of the cell.*

A benchmarking library that compares cubic (6-connected) and FCC/rhombic
dodecahedral (12-connected) lattice topologies across graph theory,
spatial operations, and signal processing.

## The Numbers

| Metric | FCC vs Cubic | Scale |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Average shortest path | **30% shorter** | 125 – 8,000 nodes |
| Graph diameter | **40% smaller** | 125 – 8,000 nodes |
| Algebraic connectivity | **2.4× higher** | 125 – 8,000 nodes |
| Flood fill reach | **55% more nodes** | 125 – 8,000 nodes |
| NN query speed | **17% faster** | 125 – 8,000 nodes |
| Signal reconstruction | **5-10× lower MSE** | 216 – 1,000 samples |
| Reconstruction isotropy | **5-20× more uniform** | 216 – 1,000 samples |
| Embedding neighbor recall | **+15-26pp at 1-hop** | 125 – 1,000 nodes |
| Information diffusion | **1.4-2× faster** | 125 – 1,000 nodes |
| Edge cost | ~2× more edges | (the price) |

These ratios are stable across all tested scales. They hold at every size
tested, consistent with derivation from Voronoi cell geometry rather than
sample size.

## The Question

Computation is built on the cube. Memory is linear. Pixels are square.
Voxels are cubic. Nobody chose this — it accumulated. Descartes gave us
orthogonal coordinates. Von Neumann gave us linear memory. The cubic
lattice is the spatial expression of Cartesian geometry.

Is the cube optimal? This library measures the alternative: the
face-centered cubic lattice, whose Voronoi cells are rhombic
dodecahedra. 12 faces instead of 6. The densest sphere packing in
three dimensions (Kepler, announced Hales 1998, published 2005, formally
verified 2017). The lattice that nature
uses for copper, aluminum, and gold.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install rhombic            # minimal (numpy + networkx)
pip install "rhombic[viz]"     # add matplotlib for plots
pip install "rhombic[all]"     # everything including dev tools
```

Reproduce all results:

```bash
python -m rhombic.benchmark
```

Use in code:

```python
from rhombic.lattice import CubicLattice, FCCLattice

cubic = CubicLattice(n=10)     # 1000 nodes, 6-connected
fcc = FCCLattice(n=6)          # ~864 nodes, 12-connected

# Convert to networkx for any graph analysis
G_cubic = cubic.to_networkx()
G_fcc = fcc.to_networkx()
```

## Results

### Rung 1: Graph Theory (complete)

Four metrics, three scales, consistent ratios. The FCC lattice outperforms
the cubic lattice on every measure of routing efficiency and structural
robustness. The cost is bounded: ~2× edges for ~30% shorter paths and
~2.4× robustness.

### Rung 2: Spatial Operations (complete)

The routing advantage translates. FCC flood fill reaches 55% more nodes
per hop. Nearest-neighbor queries are 17% faster. Range queries return
24% more nodes per volume (denser packing). The cost: range query time
scales with density — 3-5× slower for sphere/box queries at 8,000 nodes.

- [What the numbers mean](results/rung-2/INTERPRETATION.md)

### Rung 3: Signal Processing (complete)

Direct empirical measurements confirm the FCC advantage. FCC spatial sampling
produces **5-10× lower MSE** and **5-20× more isotropic** reconstruction than
cubic sampling at matched sample counts. The advantage peaks in the mid-frequency range (10-60% of
Nyquist) and grows with scale — from +6 dB at 216 samples to +10 dB at 1,000.
Above Nyquist, both lattices alias and cubic's axis alignment accidentally helps.

### Rung 4: Context Architecture (complete)

Does the FCC advantage survive when the lattice organizes high-dimensional
embedding data? FCC captures **15-26 more percentage points** of an embedding's
true nearest neighbors at 1-hop. Information diffuses **1.4-2× faster**.
Consensus converges 1.58× faster at moderate scale (500 nodes), though
per-neighbor weight dilution reduces the advantage at 1,000 nodes.

### FCC Embedding Index (complete)

A proof-of-concept ANN index that organizes high-dimensional embeddings on
lattice topology. At matched node counts, the FCC index captures **+7 to +20
percentage points** more true nearest neighbors at 1-hop than the cubic index.
The only variable is the connectivity pattern.

```python
from rhombic.index import FCCIndex, CubicIndex, brute_force_knn

fcc = FCCIndex.from_target_nodes(dim=384, target_nodes=500).build(embeddings)
results = fcc.query(query_vector, k=10, hops=1)
recall = fcc.recall_at_k(queries, ground_truth, k=10, hops=1)
```

### Synthesis

The complete argument across all four rungs — cultural genealogy, empirical
evidence, cybernetic interpretation, and practical recommendations.

## Philosophy

- Reproducible by default. Every result has code that generates it.
- The geometry is the argument. The numbers are the evidence.
- Cost is always reported alongside benefit.
- Sparse results are data, not failure.
